# dlog
### Summary:
 I couldn't find any implementation of the ZK DLOG for rust yet. 
 And the information about some basic structures of the library (htss_ecdsa) is missing.
 I tried to implement my own ZK DLOG. As the result it works fine. But it needs one more component like a Fiat-Shamir transformation.
